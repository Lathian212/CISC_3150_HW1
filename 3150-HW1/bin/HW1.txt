Question 1:
Read the Brooklyn College academic integrity guidelines, and write a 
statement attesting to the fact that you read, understood and agree to all 
of it.

Question 2:
In a loop, read radiuses from a user. Calculate the area of a circle using 
the formula PI*r^2. Use the pow function, and the PI constant in the Math 
class. Pick your data types wisely. Exit when the user presses ^d. Show 
your output.

Question 3:
Write a program that reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, and 
the number of years and displays the future investment value using the 
following formula:
invest_value = invest_amount * (1 + monthly_interest_rate)^(num_years*12)
Show the output.

Question 4:
Write a program that randomly generates an integer between 1 & 12, and 
displays the English name of that month. Run the program & show the 
output.

Question 5:
Generate a 3 digit lottery number. The program prompts the user to enter a 
3 digit number and determines whether the user wins according to the 
following rules:
1) If the user input matches the lottery number in the exact order, the 
award is $10,000
2) If all the digits in the user input match all the digits in the lottery 
number, the award is $3,000.
3) If one digit in the user input matches a digit in the lottery number, 
the award is $1,000.
Test all three cases & show the output.

Question 6:
Feed a file that contains numbers into your program using command line 
redirection. Have your program read & print the file on the screen.

Question 7:
Write a program that reads three 2D points A, B, and C from the user. 
Next, calculate the length of each side of the triangle using the 
distance formula: sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2). Finally, determine if it's a 
real triangle. For a triangle to be real, the sum of any two sides needs 
to be greater than the third. Make sure your output has some real and at 
least one fake triangle.

Question 8:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center coordinates and 
radiuses of two circles. Determine whether the are separate from each 
other, touching each other, overlapping each other, or completely within 
one another. Test each case and show the output.

Question 9:
Write a program that plays a number guessing game with the user. Give 
hints to whether the secret number is higher or lower than the user's 
guess. When the user finally gets it right, print "Horay!"
